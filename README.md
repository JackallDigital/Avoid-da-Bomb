# Avoid-da-Bomb

Avod da BOMB-a! is a Ninja Fruit style game.

As a challenge I implemented a mouse trail, so the player can also hold the mouse instead of clicking on objects to destroy them.
I also made it so that the set volume level is saved between scenes (menu/game) and the volume increases from 0 to set level on game start and goes back down to 0 on game end, which is what the video showcases.
